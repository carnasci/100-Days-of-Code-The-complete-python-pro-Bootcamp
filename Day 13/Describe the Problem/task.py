# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# The function is looping in a range of numbers between 1 and 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# When i is 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# That it will equal 20 at some point
